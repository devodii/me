Hi, I'm Emmanuel.
A talented 18yo kid who started to learn to code on an android phone in 2022.

Since then, I've built products like [TarotMaster](https://tarotmaster.ai), [AsapForms](https://asap-forms.vercel.app), and I'm committed to sharing all my learnings to inspire others in their journey.

I write about full stack development and the things i learn in general on [Medium](https://medium.com/@devodii), and I'm also raising my audience on LinkedIn.

My Tech stack includes Next.js, TypeScript, Express/Nest.js, Shadcn UI, Supabase, Drizzle.

In my free time, I enjoy playing the bass guitar or watching a movie.
