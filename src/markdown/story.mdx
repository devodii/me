In 2022, I started to learn to code through [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) on an Android phone. \

Since then, I've built products like tarotmaster.ai, betali.st, and I'm committed to sharing all my learnings to inspire others in their journey.

My favorite tech stack includes React/Next.js, TypeScript, Express/Nest.js, GraphQL, Supabase, and of course, Nx ❤️.

I'm currently on a quest to secure a role at OpenAI, Stripe, Vercel, or Discord. So, if you know anyone there, please put in a good word for me to the team lead.

If I'm not working or [tweeting](https://twitter.com/devodii_), you'll find me listening to podcasts about startups. When I'm even bored with that, I just learn to play the bass guitar.
